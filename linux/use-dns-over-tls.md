sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Rewrite the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf file and specify that we will use Cloudflare DNS in it
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf &>/dev/null << EOF
[Resolve]
DNS=1.1.1.1#one.one.one.one
DNS=2606:4700:4700::1111#one.one.one.one
DNS=1.0.0.1#one.one.one.one
DNS=2606:4700:4700::1001#one.one.one.one
DNSOverTLS=yes
EOF

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file
[ -e /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf ] && sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart Systemd-Resolved for the changes to take effect

sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf &>/dev/null << EOF
nameserver 1.1.1.1
