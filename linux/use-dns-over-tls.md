## ALTERNATIVE: Mullvad DNS (Recommended)

We are using Mullvad DNS here. This DNS service blocks ads, trackers, and malware.

```shell
# Enable and start Systemd-Resolved
sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Rewrite the /etc/systemd/resolved.conf file and specify that we will use Mullvad DNS in it
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf &>/dev/null << EOF
[Resolve]
DNS=194.242.2.4#base.dns.mullvad.net
DNS=2a07:e340::4#base.dns.mullvad.net
DNS=194.242.2.2#dns.mullvad.net
DNS=2a07:e340::2#dns.mullvad.net
DNSOverTLS=yes
EOF

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart Systemd-Resolved for the changes to take effect
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

## ALTERNATIVE: Cloudflare DNS

DNS=1.0.0.1#one.one.one.one
DNS=2606:4700:4700::1001#one.one.one.one

EOF

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file

## ALTERNATIVE: Yandex DNS

DNS=77.88.8.1#common.dot.dns.yandex.net

sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

# Leave the Systemd-Resolved configuration blank
sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf &>/dev/null <<< ""

# Make /etc/resolv.conf a symlink to Systemd-Resolved file
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart Systemd-Resolved for the changes to take effect
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```
